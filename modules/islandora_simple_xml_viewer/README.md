# Islandora Simple XML Viewer

Islandora viewer that allows easy styling of XML files managed by the Islandora XML Solution Pack using the [Google Javascript Code Prettifier](https://github.com/google/code-prettify).

This viewer is fairly simple so it also serves as an example to developers who want to write their own custom viewers. Using the [Islandora Simple XML Context](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_solution_pack_xml/tree/7.x/modules/islandora_simple_xml_context) module, you can use multiple viewers on your site that are invoked using any Context condition. Pretty useful.
